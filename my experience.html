<p> ~~My Experience~~

<p align="center"> My university experiences thus far have been amazing. I have learned and experienced so many new things in such a short period of time, and it has gone by so fast. I am still discovering all the opportunities that university offers me. UITM MACHANG is a very welcoming place, and from the first day, I felt at home here. I have made many new friends from many different backgrounds. 
<p align="center"> My classes are great and I enjoy every one of them, especially IMD311. The depth and detail of what we are leaning is far beyond my high school experience. It is just amazing to think that even the tiniest details on this subject can have such a huge impact. My coding class is also interesting because it is very easy to learn. It has made me realize how everything action is related to program. That is probably the best part of university. It introduces so many new concepts that changes our view of the world.  The course load is intense, so time management is key.
